# Idea of extension

An extension that could blur some apps in the overview (just like the "blur preview" on Android), based on differents factors.

Being able to desactivate blurring with right/middle click (or something like this) would be a huge plus.

This could be extended, as a "blur this app when I am not focusing it" or "blur all apps that I don't focus".
